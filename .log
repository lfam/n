DONE: Use POSIX parameter expansion to strip paths and file extension suffixes from
output instead of sed. Will this require a "strip" function to make it clean in
pipelines?

DONE: Also, how about allowing n -w to output nonexistent paths in addition to an
error message on stderr and an error exit code? This way, n -w could be used by
other programs to create files.

How about some 'set' magic to allow multiple arguments in the positional
parameters while preserving the ability to put options and flags out of order?

for arg in $@
	if arg is opt
		remove it
	else
		continue
parsing is done, do program

DONE: Return exit status so that output of -w can be parsed reliably. Also, write
errors to stderr

ANNOYING, not doing: If there is an argument without a command flag, check if it is a path in
note_path, and if it is, open it in $EDITOR.
