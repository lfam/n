How about some 'set' magic to allow multiple arguments in the positional
parameters while preserving the ability to put options and flags out of order?

for arg in $@
	if arg is opt
		remove it
	else
		continue
parsing is done, do program

Return exit status so that output of -w can be parsed reliably. Also, write
errors to stderr

If there is an argument without a command flag, check if it is a path in
note_path, and if it is, open it in $EDITOR.
