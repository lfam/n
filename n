You can change your notes directory by editing "'$notepath'" in $npath

Usage:	n				# print list of all notes
	n <optional note> -w		# print path to notes or specific note
	n <search string>		# search your notes for string
	n <note> -n			# open note in nano text editor
	n -h OR -help OR --help		# print this help page
	Modes -n and -w can be placed before or after a note title.
